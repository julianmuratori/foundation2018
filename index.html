                <p>The Jewish Foundation of Greater Toronto is here to bring your philanthropic dreams to life.</p>
                <p>We all have dreams. For ourselves, our families, our community, our country and our world. But we are not just dreamers,
                we are doers. Dreams without action remain intangible thoughts. Dreams with action change the future.</p>
                <p>The Jewish people know that dreams coupled with action make history. In April 2018 we celebrated the 70th anniversary of
                the fulfillment of a most impossible dream, the creation of our Jewish State of Israel.</p>
                <p>All of us worry about what the future holds, both for Israel and for our own local Jewish community. We don’t have to be
                passive worriers, we can all do something about it. This is where the Jewish Foundation comes in.</p>
                <p>We offer many strategies that will enable you to ensure that the programs and projects that you care about continue to be
                supported and thrive, which lead to the continued strength of Jewish Toronto and of Israel. Whether you are interested in
                supporting the UJA Annual Campaign, committing continued funding to a specific project or institution, or creating a Donor
                Advised Fund that can allocate to charities as needs and interests evolve, the Jewish Foundation has something for you. Our
                strategies can be funded through cash, donations of stock, insurance policies, bequests and in many other ways. All strategies
                have meaningful tax benefits.</p>
                <p>The Jewish Foundation’s performance in its fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was fantastic by all measures. Assets increased
                from $331.2 million to $380.6 million (excluding another $199.6 million of planned gifts), distributions to the community
                totalled $26 million and our investment performance was 11.1%. Thank you to our hard working professional staff, our committed
                Trustees and all of our volunteers whose passion and dedication have led to these results.</p>
                <p>On the pages of this Report to the Community you will see what we do. If you are already one of our 1,400 fund holders or
                planned givers, thank you for your vision. If you are not yet a member of the Jewish Foundation family and you see something
                in this report that you would like to know more about, please contact us. We are here to bring your philanthropic dreams
                to life.</p>

                    and develop a deep appreciation for the survival of the Jewish people and the creation of the State of Israel.</p>

                    <p>As the eldest son of immigrants from Morocco, my family and I directly benefitted from the network of established non-profit

                    the Jewish Day School system. Despite our modest means, we never lacked for essentials and grew up with a full appreciation
                    of Jewish tradition and pride in our Moroccan heritage.</p>

                    <h4>Moniek & Genia Prusznowski z”l</h4>
                    <p>Our parents, Moniek and Genia Prusznowski z”l, were born in Poland and survived the devastation of the Holocaust. In spite
                    of incredible losses, they each had a surviving sibling.</p>
                    <p>After the war, Genia lived in Fehrenwald Displaced Persons (DP) Camp. One blind date with the dashing 98 pound survivor Moniek
                    resulted in marriage six weeks later, and a union that lasted 63 years. Our brother, Bernie z”l, was born in 1948 and in
                    1949, with very little money, they came to Canada to join Genia’s sister, with whom she survived the camps.</p>
                    <p>Our parents were ambitious and hard working. With time, they were able to save and put a down payment on a house near Kensington
                    Market, and to cover costs they had a boarder in each room. Resourceful Genia started Jean’s Bargain Store, and the upstairs
                    flat became home.</p>
                    <p>They opened a second store and working six days a week were able to move us to Bathurst Manor.</p>
                    <p>Despite their internal scars, they showed us love and joy. Moniek with his exuberance and motivation, and Genia with her
                    foresight and internal fortitude, were the driving forces in our family.</p>
                    <p>Our parents lived with integrity and honesty. We learned both the value of a dollar and the dignity of hard work. They taught
                    us that no matter how difficult life was, internal strength would help you not only survive but flourish.</p>

                            <p>A Lion of Judah Endowment (LOJE) is a key part of the UJA Legacy initiative. Through LOJE, Jewish women strengthen the Jewish
                            community by providing funds to meet needs at home, in Israel and around the world. This year, more than 80 women participated
                            in the annual Spring event. Some already had a flame on their Lion of Judah pin indicating their commitment to the future
                            while others came to be inspired.</p>

                    for my children and grandchildren. This gift is an example of my unwavering support and respect for our rich history; its
                    beliefs, convictions and faith in our strong future. As in generations past, I hope my children will contribute to community.
                    Through LOJE gifts, women are strengthening the Jewish community and setting an example for future generations of women.
                    This is very important to me as it shall be our children who shall lead and be our community's future ambassadors.</p>

                        <p>Distributed to over 6,000 advisors, this e-newsletter is written by both PAC members and other advisors. It provides advisors with up-to-date resources that help them better understand the personal and ﬁnancial beneﬁts of how clients’ giving patterns are an important part of responsible ﬁnancial and estate planning.</p>

                        <p>The Jewish Foundation holds two educational seminars per year for an audience of professional advisors who are eligible for
                        Continuing Education Credits. These seminars offer timely and relevant tax, legal and estate planning topics, strategies
                        for having the “philanthropic conversation” with clients, and act as a forum for networking.</p>

                        <p>The Professional Advisors Award of Excellence honours individuals who encourage their clients to consider charity as part of their estate or ﬁnancial planning process. They are the most ardent ambassadors and champions of the Jewish Foundation and set a proud example for other lawyers, accountants and estate planners in our community.</p>
                        <p>This year, Jamie Golombek, Managing Director, Tax & Estate Planning with CIBC in Toronto, received the Jewish Foundation’s
                        Professional Advisors Award of Excellence for his contribution to charitable giving through his professional practice, his
                        volunteer service to the Jewish Foundation and for assisting in structuring gifts for the community through the Jewish Foundation.</p>

                        <p>The Book of Life is an ongoing program that recognizes donors who leave a charitable legacy through the Jewish Foundation.
                        A legacy may be left in many forms including a charitable fund, a gift in your Will or a gift of life insurance.</p>
            
                        <p>Donors to the Jewish Foundation are invited to include their story, focusing on their beliefs, their motivation for giving
                        and the special influences and people who shared their lives. The Book of Life has become an inspiring tradition in our community
                        that celebrates Jewish lives and encourages future generations to live by and embrace the values of tzedakah and the Jewish
                        community.</p>
            
                        <p>This year’s Book of Life Celebration recognized 20 honourees. Over 350 people attended and were inspired by guest speaker
                        Jeannie Smith, the daughter of Polish rescuer Irene Gut Opdyke, who received international recognition for her actions during
                        the Holocaust while working for a high ranking German official.</p>

                        <p>For the past 15 years, community members who have left a legacy had the opportunity to be recognized through the Foundation’s
                        meaningful Book of Life program. They wrote their stories, focusing on their Jewish values, reasons for giving, and those
                        who taught them about the importance of giving back. These stories are an important part of the ever-evolving story that
                        is Jewish Toronto and play an important role in inspiring others to live by the values of tzedakah, community and continuity.</p>

                        <p>By transferring ownership of an existing life insurance policy to the Jewish Foundation, the donor is entitled to an immediate

                        <p>In addition, all future premium payments are eligible for a donation tax receipt.</p>

                        <p>New Policies</p>
                        <p>By designating the Jewish Foundation as owner and beneficiary of the life insurance policy, premium payments will be made
                        to the Jewish Foundation by the donor annually and are eligible for a donation tax receipt.</p>

                        <h4>Charitable Bequests:</h4>
                        <p>A gift in your Will is a simple and thoughtful way to leave a legacy. Whether it is a set amount or a percentage of the estate,
                        donors can make a difference for generations to come.</p>
