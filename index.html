                <p>The Jewish Foundation of Greater Toronto is here to bring your philanthropic dreams to life.</p>
                <p>We all have dreams. For ourselves, our families, our community, our country and our world. But we are not just dreamers,
                we are doers. Dreams without action remain intangible thoughts. Dreams with action change the future.</p>
                <p>The Jewish people know that dreams coupled with action make history. In April 2018 we celebrated the 70th anniversary of
                the fulfillment of a most impossible dream, the creation of our Jewish State of Israel.</p>
                <p>All of us worry about what the future holds, both for Israel and for our own local Jewish community. We don’t have to be
                passive worriers, we can all do something about it. This is where the Jewish Foundation comes in.</p>
                <p>We offer many strategies that will enable you to ensure that the programs and projects that you care about continue to be
                supported and thrive, which lead to the continued strength of Jewish Toronto and of Israel. Whether you are interested in
                supporting the UJA Annual Campaign, committing continued funding to a specific project or institution, or creating a Donor
                Advised Fund that can allocate to charities as needs and interests evolve, the Jewish Foundation has something for you. Our
                strategies can be funded through cash, donations of stock, insurance policies, bequests and in many other ways. All strategies
                have meaningful tax benefits.</p>
                <p>The Jewish Foundation’s performance in its fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was fantastic by all measures. Assets increased
                from $331.2 million to $380.6 million (excluding another $199.6 million of planned gifts), distributions to the community
                totalled $26 million and our investment performance was 11.1%. Thank you to our hard working professional staff, our committed
                Trustees and all of our volunteers whose passion and dedication have led to these results.</p>
                <p>On the pages of this Report to the Community you will see what we do. If you are already one of our 1,400 fund holders or
                planned givers, thank you for your vision. If you are not yet a member of the Jewish Foundation family and you see something
                in this report that you would like to know more about, please contact us. We are here to bring your philanthropic dreams
                to life.</p>

                    <p>Our parents, Moniek and Genia Prusznowski z”l, were born in Poland and survived the devastation of the Holocaust. In spite
                    of incredible losses, they each had a surviving sibling.</p>
                    <p>After the war, Genia lived in Fehrenwald Displaced Persons (DP) Camp. One blind date with the dashing 98 pound survivor Moniek
                    resulted in marriage six weeks later, and a union that lasted 63 years. Our brother, Bernie z”l, was born in 1948 and in
                    1949, with very little money, they came to Canada to join Genia’s sister, with whom she survived the camps.</p>
                    <p>Our parents were ambitious and hard working. With time, they were able to save and put a down payment on a house near Kensington
                    Market, and to cover costs they had a boarder in each room. Resourceful Genia started Jean’s Bargain Store, and the upstairs
                    flat became home.</p>
                    <p>They opened a second store and working six days a week were able to move us to Bathurst Manor.</p>
                    <p>Despite their internal scars, they showed us love and joy. Moniek with his exuberance and motivation, and Genia with her
                    foresight and internal fortitude, were the driving forces in our family.</p>
                    <p>Our parents lived with integrity and honesty. We learned both the value of a dollar and the dignity of hard work. They taught
                    us that no matter how difficult life was, internal strength would help you not only survive but flourish.</p>

                        <p class="bolBody">The Book of Life is an ongoing program that recognizes donors who leave a charitable legacy through the Jewish Foundation.
                        A legacy may be left in many forms including a charitable fund, a gift in your Will or a gift of life insurance.</p>
            
                        <p class="bolBody">Donors to the Jewish Foundation are invited to include their story, focusing on their beliefs, their motivation for giving
                        and the special influences and people who shared their lives. The Book of Life has become an inspiring tradition in our community
                        that celebrates Jewish lives and encourages future generations to live by and embrace the values of tzedakah and the Jewish
                        community.</p>
            
                        <p class="bolBody">This year’s Book of Life Celebration recognized 20 honourees. Over 350 people attended and were inspired by guest speaker
                        Jeannie Smith, the daughter of Polish rescuer Irene Gut Opdyke, who received international recognition for her actions during
                        the Holocaust while working for a high ranking German official.</p>

                        who taught them about the importance of giving back. These stories are an important part of the ever-evolving story that
                        is Jewish Toronto and play an important role in inspiring others to live by the values of tzedakah, community and continuity.</p>

                    <p>A Planned Gift is a charitable gift such as life insurance or a gift through your Will, ultimately creating a Charitable

                    tax receipt for the fair market value of the policy.</p>
                    <p>In addition, all future premium payments are eligible for a donation tax receipt.</p>

                    <p>By designating the Jewish Foundation as owner and beneficiary of the life insurance policy, premium payments will be made
                    to the Jewish Foundation by the donor annually and are eligible for a donation tax receipt.</p>

                    <h4 class="doTogether--body__subheadings">Charitable Bequests:</h4>
                    <p>A gift in your Will is a simple and thoughtful way to leave a legacy. Whether it is a set amount or a percentage of the estate,
                    donors can make a difference for generations to come.</p>
